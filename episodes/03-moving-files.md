## moving files around

Rclone is most frequently used to move files, individually or as a group from one place to another.


The syntax for the places, to or from is:

source:folder     destination:folder   

or

local/path  remote/path

## valid remote names

##### more examples:

rclone **ls** remote:path # **lists contents of a remote**
rclone **copy** /local/path remote:path # **copies&& /local/path to the remote
rclone **sync** --interactive /local/path remote:path # **syncs** /local/path to the remote


##### my home backup to an external drive (windows using linux subsystem)
rclone sync /mnt/d/work-related /mnt/f/work-related-backup


## Different operating systems have __slightly__ different syntax 

Windows syntax:   rclone ls C:\Users\jjamison\rclone
Linux syntax:  rclone ls /mnt/c/Users/jjamison/rclone
