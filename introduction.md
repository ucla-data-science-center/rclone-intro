## Rclone command syntax

### `rclone [command] source:source-folder  destination:destination-folder`

## Real-World Scenarios for Using Rclone

Understanding how Rclone works can be easier if you relate it to everyday tasks. Here are a few simple examples:

- **Copy:**  
  Imagine you have a folder of vacation photos on your laptop and want to back them up to Google Drive without removing them from your computer. Using `rclone copy` will duplicate your pictures to the cloud, leaving the originals intact.

- **Sync:**  
  Suppose you're working on a project at home and in the office. You keep a copy of your project folder on your computer and a backup in the cloud. With `rclone sync`, any changes you make locally are automatically mirrored in the cloud folder, keeping them the same.

- **Move:**  
  After completing a project, you can free up space on your computer by archiving files to the cloud. The `rclone move` command transfers your project files to cloud storage and deletes them from your local drive.

These examples show how each rclone command can help you manage your files based on your needs.
